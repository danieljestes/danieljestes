Daniel Jestes, He/him

This respository holds everything for my personal Digital Portfolio for St. Lawrence University. While this repositoty is currently public, as new content is added and the webiste is expanded, I may decide to make it private due to the website, and not its source code, being the thing I want to share publically.

That being said, if any average user is to stumlb eupon this feel free to copy what is available as inspiration for basic website design (although it might be a while before there is anything worth while to view here).
